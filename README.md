# Heart Disease Detection with Machine Learning

Developed independently through the UC Davis AI Student Collective Club, this project explores the use of machine learning algorithms for early detection of heart disease based on medical features.

##  Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease from patient data, aiming to support preventative care through accurate classification.

##  Machine Learning Models

The following algorithms were implemented and compared:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **XGBoost**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Decision Tree**

Each model was trained on structured health data and evaluated based on accuracy and interpretability.

##  Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated models using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1 Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC AUC curves**

The final section includes a **comparison of accuracy across models** to highlight strengths and tradeoffs.

##  Dataset

- Sourced from a heart disease dataset containing patient features such as:
  - Age, sex, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, etc.
- Preprocessed with:
  - Missing value handling
  - Feature encoding
  - Train-test splitting

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

##  Project Goals

- Explore different classification techniques in a health context
- Understand model tradeoffs in accuracy vs interpretability
- Learn evaluation techniques for imbalanced medical datasets
- Communicate results clearly using visualizations and model comparison

##  Context

This was a collaborative educational project within the **UC Davis AI Student Collective Club**, designed to:
- Demonstrate practical AI in healthcare
- Share findings with professors and fellow students
- Build portfolio-ready machine learning experience
